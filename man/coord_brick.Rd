\title{Cartesian coordinates with fixed "aspect ratio"}
\usage{
coord_brick(
  bricks_per_layer = 4,
  ratio = NULL,
  xlim = NULL,
  ylim = NULL,
  expand = TRUE,
  clip = "on"
)

coord_brick_waffle(
  bricks_per_layer = 4,
  ratio = NULL,
  xlim = NULL,
  ylim = NULL,
  expand = TRUE,
  clip = "on"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{bricks_per_layer}{Number of bricks per layer. Should match the `bricks_per_layer`
specification in `geom_brick`. Default is `4`.}

\item{ratio}{aspect ratio, expressed as `y / x`}

\item{xlim, ylim}{Limits for the x and y axes.}

\item{expand}{If `TRUE`, the default, adds a small expansion factor to
the limits to ensure that data and axes don't overlap. If `FALSE`,
limits are taken exactly from the data or `xlim`/`ylim`.}

\item{clip}{Should drawing be clipped to the extent of the plot panel? A
setting of `"on"` (the default) means yes, and a setting of `"off"`
means no. In most cases, the default of `"on"` should not be changed,
as setting `clip = "off"` can cause unexpected results. It allows
drawing of data points anywhere on the plot, including in the plot margins.}
}
\description{
A fixed scale coordinate system forces a specified ratio similar to
`coord_fixed`. It holds the coordinates fixed at the right ratio
to ensure each brick is of the right dimensions.
